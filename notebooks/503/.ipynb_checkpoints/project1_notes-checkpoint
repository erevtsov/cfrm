Compare allocations for each model. Explain aspects of the dat that lead to differences in solutions.
	* 

How does periodicity affect results?
	* LQD/SHY balance changes w/ periodicity... allocation to LQD much lower monthly, quarterly than other frequencies

How does measure affect results?

How does return target affect results?
	* at 6% target the frequency of data has a higher impact - there's a larger dispersion of weights.
